# Homework #4 

### 1. What are main three categories of cloud service models?
- IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service)
- PaaS  (Platform as a Service)
- SaaS (Software as a Service)
- If electricity is very expensive in Taiwan, then the IaaS business model may not be suitable for providing cloud services in Taiwan. IaaS relies heavily on the use of physical infrastructure, such as servers and data centers, which require a significant amount of electricity to operate.

### 2. Discuss how your company can use Google App Engine?
- If my company plan to use Google App Engine, we can build, host and scale a machine learning application for flower image classification without worrying the underlying infrastructure, such as servers, storage and networking. Following steps may occurs:
	1. Sign up a Google Cloud account and create a new project in GCP.
	2. Take advantage of pre-trained ML APIs to our application.
	3. Build our app using a runtime environment supported by GCP such as Java, Python, Nodejs, and integrate the ML-model to the app.
	4. Use the simple interface provided by GCP to easily deploy the whole application.
- Potential cost ?
	- If our application exceeds the limit of the free trial, we will be charged for the additional resources.
- AWS vs Azure vs GCP ?
	- AWS is the oldest and most mature of these platforms. AWS has a large ecosystem of tools, integrations and communities.
	- GCP is similar to AWS but more focuses on machine learning and AI applications.
	- Azure provides similar service above all, but more focuses on integration with Microsoft products and services, such as VS and Office.

### 3. Virtualization
-  Docker vs VM ?
	1. VM and Docker are both used for running app in isolated environment.
	2. VM is a software-based emulation of a physical computer, with its OS, memory, and storage.
	3. Docker is containerization technology that allows developers to pack app into lightweight containers, providing a consistent runtime environment for applications.
	4. VM is OS-based while Docker is application-based.
	5. VM costs more hardware resources than Docker.
- One example ppplication suitable for Docker but not suitable for VM
	1. Microservice-based application in modern web development. Docker-based technique is a best choice for microservices because it allows us to package and deploy small service in a lightweight and portable environment.
